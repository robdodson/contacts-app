Note: This app is currently only designed for mobile screens so you'll want to view it using mobile emulation in your browser or on a mobile device.

## Getting Started

- git clone https://github.com/robdodson/contacts-app.git
- `cd contacts-app`
- `npm install && bower install`
- `grunt serve`

## Supported actions

- Scroll through a list of contacts
- Click the add button to see a mock 'add contact' page
- Click a contact to see more info

## Add to homescreen

For the best experience you should add the app to your homescreen. That will get rid of the URL bar at the top and give you much more vertical room to scroll around
